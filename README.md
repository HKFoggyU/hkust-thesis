[中文说明](README_CN.md)

HKUST Thesis template for RPG students implemented with LaTeX3.

## Getting started

Try this template online on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/hkustthesis/mstwvckmhmjg) (or [TeXPage](https://www.texpage.com/template/373737be-dc33-4df2-a7d0-a512a92715ef)) in 1 minute! You only need to do 2 things:

1. Remember to change the `Compiler` to **`XeLaTeX`** in the settings, otherwise it may fail to compile.
   - for Overleaf, via the top left `Menu` button
   - for TeXPage, via the top right `Setting` button
3. Download and read carefully the **[PDF documentation](https://github.com/HKFoggyU/hkust-thesis/releases/latest/download/hkustthesis.pdf)** before you edit your thesis.

Alternatively, you can download the [release zip file](https://github.com/HKFoggyU/hkust-thesis/releases/latest) and try it on your local machine.

## Disclaimer

FYTGS doesn't provide any template for thesis submission. They only emphasize that the submitted PDF file should meet the requirements in the [RPG Handbook](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/academics/Academic-Regulations-and-Requirements/Handbook-for-Research-Postgraduate-Studies/guidelines-thesis-preparation).

This template has tried its best to follow the above requirements in the RPG Handbook and also the formatting instructions of the sample pages ([MPhil](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/imce/thesis_sample_page_mphil.pdf)/[PhD](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/imce/thesis_sample_page_phd.pdf)) provided by the RPG Handbook. However, this template takes no responsibility for any potential inconsistency.
